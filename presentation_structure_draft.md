# Introduction to GraphQL (for FE Developers)

## What is GraphQL?

Definition of GraphQL
A query language for APIs
Developed by Facebook
Comparison with REST
## Why Use GraphQL?

Advantages of GraphQL for mobile developers
Efficient data loading and reduced over-fetching
Declarative data fetching
Strongly typed schemas and introspection
Faster app development and improved performance
GraphQL's role in microservices architecture
## How Does GraphQL Work?

Overview of GraphQL's architecture
Schema definition language (SDL)
Query, mutation, and subscription operations
Resolver functions and data fetching
GraphQL clients and server implementations
## Schema Stitching

Explanation of schema stitching
Combining multiple GraphQL schemas
Creating a unified schema for a gateway server
Schema stitching tools and libraries
Benefits and considerations for mobile developers
## Architecture Examples

GraphQL architecture examples for mobile development
Monolithic architecture with a single GraphQL endpoint
Modular architecture with multiple GraphQL services
Federated architecture with independent GraphQL microservices
Hybrid approaches and considerations for scaling

## GraphQL vs. REST Comparison

Comparison between GraphQL and REST
Understanding the differences and trade-offs

### Brief explanation of REST (Representational State Transfer)
Principles of RESTful architecture
Resource-based endpoints and HTTP methods
Over-fetching and under-fetching of data
Subslide 2: GraphQL Overview

### Recap of GraphQL's query language for APIs
Single endpoint for flexible data retrieval
Declarative data fetching and filtering
Reduced data transfer and minimized network requests
Subslide 3: Flexibility and Efficiency

### Comparison of flexibility between GraphQL and REST
GraphQL's ability to request only the required data
REST's fixed data structure and potential for over-fetching
Efficiency gains with GraphQL's batched requests
Subslide 4: Front-End Development Experience

### Discussion on front-end development experience
REST's multiple endpoint calls for related data
GraphQL's ability to retrieve related data in a single request
Improved developer productivity with GraphQL
Subslide 5: Versioning and Backward Compatibility

### Versioning challenges in REST APIs
Impact on clients during API changes
GraphQL's built-in backward compatibility and gradual schema evolution
Easier API evolution with GraphQL
Subslide 6: Caching and Performance

### Caching differences between GraphQL and REST
Challenges with REST's granular endpoint caching
GraphQL's per-field caching and efficient data retrieval
Performance considerations and benefits of GraphQL
Subslide 7: Conclusion
